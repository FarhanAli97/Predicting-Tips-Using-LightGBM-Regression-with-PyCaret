# Predicting-Tips-Using-LightGBM-Regression-with-PyCaret

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) regression model using PyCaret to predict the tip amount in the Tips dataset. The goal of this project is to analyze the factors that influence tipping behavior and build a predictive model to estimate tips based on features like total bill, party size, day of the week, and more.

The notebook covers the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the Tips dataset and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

Model Training:

Use PyCaret to set up the regression environment.

Train and compare multiple regression models to identify the best-performing one.

Model Tuning:

Perform hyperparameter tuning on the LightGBM model to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, RÂ², and MAPE.

Visualize model performance using residual plots, prediction error plots, and feature importance.

Prediction:

Generate predictions on the test dataset and save the results.

Conclusion:

Summarize the findings and suggest potential improvements.

Key Features:
Automated Machine Learning: Leverages PyCaret for automated model selection, training, and tuning.

LightGBM: Utilizes the Light Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm for efficient and accurate predictions.

Comprehensive Evaluation: Includes detailed performance metrics and visualizations to assess model performance.

Dataset:
The Tips dataset contains information about restaurant tips, including the following features:

total_bill: Total bill amount.

tip: Tip amount (target variable).

sex: Gender of the bill payer.

smoker: Whether the party included smokers.

day: Day of the week.

time: Time of day (Lunch/Dinner).

size: Size of the party.

The dataset is widely used for regression and classification tasks to understand tipping behavior.
